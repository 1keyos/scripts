# at this point. By changing CONFIG_PROTECT, several of these have become
# permanently stale, as neither tool considers them updates anymore.

# First discard all updates in config files that are still protected, as
# governed by the current CONFIG_PROTECT.
# Autodiscard is option "-9" followed by the "YES" confirmation.
